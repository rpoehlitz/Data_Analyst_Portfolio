# Portfolio Python Folder
This Python portfolio folder showcases my skills and projects related to football analytics. The folder includes two significant projects: a Visualization Tool for football match analysis and an Expected Goal Model. Below is a brief overview of each project along with instructions on how to explore and use them.

## 1. Visualization Tool
Description:
The Visualization Tool is a Python application that provides an interactive and visual representation of football match statistics, specifically focusing on Expected Goals (xG). It allows users to select a competition, season, and match, and then generates an xG chart for the selected match. The chart displays cumulative Expected Goals over time for both home and away teams, along with markers for goal events.

How to Use:
Run the main() function in the xg-chart.py script.
Follow the prompts to select a competition, season, and match.
The tool will display an xG chart for the chosen match, showing the progression of Expected Goals throughout the game.
2. Expected Goal Model
Description:
The Expected Goal Model is a Python script that implements a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a shot resulting in a goal. It utilizes features such as shot distance, angle, and other relevant statistics to calculate Expected Goals. The model is trained on historical football match data and can be used to assess the quality of scoring opportunities.

How to Use:
Open the expected_goal_model.py script.
Follow the step-by-step instructions to understand the process of building, training, and evaluating the Expected Goal Model.
Use the provided code and guidelines to apply the model to your own football match data.
Dependencies:
Make sure to install the necessary dependencies before running the scripts. You can install them using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Feel free to explore, modify, and learn from the code in this portfolio folder. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to reach out.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
